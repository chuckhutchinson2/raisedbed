This project was developed under the funding of a Night's And Weekend's Project,

Otherwise known as a NAW project!

Typically, NAW projects are underfunded & overdeveloped, yet push technology to its limits.
Unfortunately though, NAW projects have no business objective or purpose; so they can't be sold.
Later NAW code becomes suitable for open source code, or makes its way into production code
during cut and paste operations.
